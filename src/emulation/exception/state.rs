//! Per-thread exception handling state for .NET emulation.
//!
//! This module manages the exception handling state for a single thread during emulation.
//! Each thread in a .NET application has its own exception state, tracking the currently
//! active exception, pending cleanup handlers, and control flow during exception handling.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The .NET runtime maintains exception state per thread. When an exception is thrown,
//! this state tracks:
//!
//! - The active exception object and its type
//! - Pending finally blocks that must execute during unwinding
//! - Filter evaluation state (for `catch when` clauses)
//! - Rethrow requests from catch handlers
//! - Leave instruction targets for normal exit from try blocks
//!
//! # State Transitions
//!
//! Exception state transitions through several phases:
//!
//! 1. **Normal execution** - No exception active
//! 2. **Exception thrown** - Exception set, handling begins
//! 3. **Handler search** - Looking for catch/filter handlers
//! 4. **Cleanup execution** - Running finally/fault blocks
//! 5. **Handler entered** - Executing catch handler code
//! 6. **Exception handled** - State cleared, normal execution resumes
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! This state is designed for single-threaded access per emulated thread.
//! Each emulated thread should have its own [`ThreadExceptionState`] instance.
