//! Emulation configuration types.
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive configuration for the emulation engine,
//! allowing fine-grained control over execution limits, memory settings,
//! stub behavior, and tracing options.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Configuration is organized into several interconnected structures:
//!
//! - [`EmulationConfig`] - Top-level configuration container
//! - [`EmulationLimits`] - Execution limits (instructions, call depth, memory)
//! - [`MemoryConfig`] - Memory subsystem settings
//! - [`StubConfig`] - Method stub behavior
//! - [`TracingConfig`] - Logging and tracing options
//! - [`CaptureConfig`] - Runtime data capture settings
//!
//! # Configuration Presets
//!
//! For common use cases, [`EmulationConfig`] provides preset configurations:
//!
//! - [`EmulationConfig::extraction()`] - Optimized for unpacking/decrypting assemblies
//! - [`EmulationConfig::analysis()`] - Optimized for static analysis
//! - [`EmulationConfig::full()`] - Complete emulation with all features
//! - [`EmulationConfig::minimal()`] - Lightweight constant folding
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use dotscope::emulation::{EmulationConfig, EmulationLimits};
//!
//! // Use a preset
//! let config = EmulationConfig::extraction();
//!
//! // Or customize
//! let config = EmulationConfig {
//!     limits: EmulationLimits::new()
//!         .with_max_instructions(10_000_000)
//!         .with_timeout_ms(30_000),
//!     symbolic_tracking: true,
//!     ..Default::default()
//! };
//! ```

/// Comprehensive emulation configuration with fine-grained control.
///
/// `EmulationConfig` is the top-level configuration container that controls
/// all aspects of .NET emulation behavior. It aggregates sub-configurations
/// for limits, memory, stubs, and tracing.
///
/// # Default Configuration
///
/// The default configuration provides reasonable settings for general use:
/// - 10 million instruction limit
/// - 1000 call depth limit
/// - 256 MB heap limit
/// - Threading and exceptions enabled
/// - All stubs enabled in non-strict mode
///
/// # Presets
///
/// Use the preset methods for common scenarios:
/// - [`extraction()`](Self::extraction) - For unpacking protected assemblies
/// - [`analysis()`](Self::analysis) - For static analysis
/// - [`full()`](Self::full) - For complete emulation
/// - [`minimal()`](Self::minimal) - For simple constant folding
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use dotscope::emulation::EmulationConfig;
///
/// // Default configuration
/// let config = EmulationConfig::default();
///
/// // Preset for extraction
/// let config = EmulationConfig::extraction();
///
/// // Custom configuration
/// let config = EmulationConfig {
///     symbolic_tracking: true,
///     threading_enabled: false,
