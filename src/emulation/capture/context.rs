//! Capture context for collecting emulation results.
//!
//! This module provides [`CaptureContext`], the central collection point for all data
//! captured during .NET emulation. It is designed for thread-safe concurrent access
//! and supports configurable capture policies.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The capture context automatically collects various types of data during emulation:
//!
//! - **Assemblies**: Loaded via `Assembly.Load(byte[])` and similar methods, useful for
//!   extracting packed or dynamically decrypted assemblies
//! - **Strings**: Decrypted or dynamically generated strings that may reveal configuration,
//!   URLs, or other sensitive data
//! - **Buffers**: Raw byte buffers from memory operations, crypto transforms, or method returns
//! - **File Operations**: File system access patterns including reads, writes, and deletions
//! - **Network Operations**: Network activity including HTTP requests, TCP connections, and DNS lookups
//! - **Memory Snapshots**: Point-in-time snapshots of configured memory regions
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! [`CaptureContext`] uses interior mutability with [`RwLock`] to allow safe concurrent
//! access from multiple emulation threads. All capture operations are non-blocking for readers
//! and use fine-grained locking.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Creating a capture context with default settings (captures everything):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use dotscope::emulation::capture::CaptureContext;
//!
//! let ctx = CaptureContext::new();
//!
//! // After emulation completes, retrieve captured data
//! for assembly in ctx.assemblies() {
//!     println!("Captured assembly: {} bytes", assembly.data.len());
//! }
//!
//! for string in ctx.strings() {
//!     println!("Decrypted string: {}", string.value);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Creating a minimal context for assembly extraction only:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use dotscope::emulation::capture::CaptureContext;
//!
//! let ctx = CaptureContext::assemblies_only();
//! // Strings, file ops, and network ops will not be captured
//! ```

/// Central context for capturing emulation results during .NET analysis.
///
/// `CaptureContext` serves as the primary collection point for all data intercepted
/// during emulation. It automatically captures assemblies loaded dynamically, decrypted
/// strings, memory buffers, file operations, and network activity based on the
/// configured [`CaptureConfig`].
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// This struct is designed for concurrent access from multiple emulation threads.
/// All internal collections are protected by [`RwLock`], allowing multiple readers
/// or a single writer at any time. Capture operations silently skip if the lock
/// cannot be acquired to avoid blocking emulation.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// Capture behavior is controlled by [`CaptureConfig`]. By default, all capture
/// types are enabled. Use [`CaptureContext::with_config`] for fine-grained control,
/// or convenience constructors like [`CaptureContext::assemblies_only`] for common
/// use cases.
///
/// # Examples

/// ```ignore
/// use dotscope::emulation::capture::CaptureContext;
