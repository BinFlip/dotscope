//! RID remapping for specific tables.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::cilassembly::remapping::rid::RidRemapper`] for managing
//! Row ID (RID) remapping within individual metadata tables during assembly modification.
//! It handles the complex task of maintaining sequential RID allocation while processing
//! chronological operations that may insert, update, or delete table rows.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`crate::cilassembly::remapping::rid::RidRemapper`] - Per-table RID remapping with conflict resolution
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The RID remapping system addresses the fundamental requirement that metadata table
//! RIDs must remain sequential (1, 2, 3, ...) in the final binary, even when operations
//! create gaps or insert rows with non-sequential RIDs.
//!
//! ## Core Challenges
//!
//! ### Sequential RID Requirement
//! ECMA-335 requires that table RIDs be sequential starting from 1 with no gaps.
//! When operations delete rows or insert with arbitrary RIDs, the remapper must
//! create a new sequential assignment.
//!
//! ### Temporal Ordering
//! Operations are processed in chronological order based on timestamps to ensure
//! deterministic conflict resolution when multiple operations target the same RID.
//!
//! ### Cross-Reference Preservation
//! All cross-references throughout the assembly must be updated to use the new
//! sequential RIDs while maintaining their semantic meaning.
//!
//! ## Remapping Process
//!
//! 1. **Operation Analysis**: Process all operations chronologically to determine final state
//! 2. **Conflict Resolution**: Apply last-write-wins logic for overlapping operations
//! 3. **Sequential Assignment**: Create gap-free sequential mapping for surviving rows
//! 4. **Cross-Reference Updates**: Update all references to use new RIDs
//!
//! # Usage Examples
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use crate::cilassembly::remapping::rid::RidRemapper;
//! use crate::cilassembly::operation::{Operation, TableOperation};
//! use crate::metadata::tables::TableDataOwned;
//!
//! // Build remapper from table operations
//! // let operations = vec![/* TableOperation instances */];
//! let original_count = 5; // Original table had 5 rows
//! // let remapper = RidRemapper::build_from_operations(&operations, original_count);
//!
//! // Query RID mappings
//! // if let Some(final_rid) = remapper.map_rid(3) {
//! //     println!("Original RID 3 maps to final RID {}", final_rid);
//! // } else {
//! //     println!("RID 3 was deleted");
//! // }
//!
//! // Get table statistics
//! // let final_count = remapper.final_row_count();
//! // let next_rid = remapper.next_available_rid();
//! ```
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! This type is [`Send`] and [`Sync`] as it contains only owned data structures
//! with no interior mutability, making it safe for concurrent read access.
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! This module integrates with:
//! - [`crate::cilassembly::remapping::index::IndexRemapper`] - Overall remapping coordination
//! - [`crate::cilassembly::operation`] - Operation definitions and temporal ordering
//! - [`crate::cilassembly::modifications::TableModifications`] - Table change tracking
//! - [`crate::cilassembly::write`] - Binary generation and cross-reference updates

/// Handles RID remapping for a specific table.
///
/// This struct manages the complex process of remapping Row IDs (RIDs) within a single
/// metadata table to ensure sequential allocation in the final binary. It processes
/// chronological operations, resolves conflicts, and maintains the ECMA-335 requirement
/// that table RIDs be sequential starting from 1 with no gaps.
///
/// # Remapping Strategy
///
/// The remapper implements a two-phase strategy:
/// 1. **Analysis Phase**: Process all operations chronologically to determine the final
///    state of each RID (exists, deleted, or modified)
/// 2. **Assignment Phase**: Create sequential RID assignments for all surviving rows,
///    ensuring no gaps in the final sequence
///
/// # Internal State
///
/// - **Mapping Table**: Maps original RIDs to final RIDs (or None for deleted rows)
/// - **Next RID**: Tracks the next available RID for new insertions  
/// - **Final Count**: Maintains the total number of rows after all operations
///
/// # Conflict Resolution
///
/// When multiple operations target the same RID, the remapper applies last-write-wins
/// conflict resolution based on operation timestamps:
/// - Later timestamps take precedence
/// - Insert followed by Delete results in no row (Delete wins)
/// - Delete followed by Insert results in a row (Insert wins)  
/// - Update operations preserve row existence and remove deletion markers
///
/// # Usage Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use crate::cilassembly::remapping::rid::RidRemapper;
/// use crate::cilassembly::operation::{Operation, TableOperation};
/// use crate::metadata::tables::TableDataOwned;
///
/// // Create remapper for table with 10 original rows
/// let mut remapper = RidRemapper::new(10);
///
/// // Or build from operations (more common)
/// // let operations = vec![/* operations */];
/// // let remapper = RidRemapper::build_from_operations(&operations, 10);
///
/// // Query RID mappings
/// match remapper.map_rid(5) {
///     Some(final_rid) => println!("RID 5 maps to {}", final_rid),
///     None => println!("RID 5 was deleted"),
/// }
///
/// // Get table statistics
/// let total_rows = remapper.final_row_count();
/// let next_available = remapper.next_available_rid();
