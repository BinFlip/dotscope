//! Operation types for table row modifications.
//!
//! This module provides the fundamental operation types for modifying metadata table rows
//! during assembly editing operations. It defines both the raw operation variants and the
//! timestamped operation wrapper used for conflict resolution and chronological ordering.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`crate::cilassembly::operation::Operation`] - Core operation variants (Insert/Update/Delete)
//! - [`crate::cilassembly::operation::TableOperation`] - Timestamped operation wrapper for conflict resolution
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The operation system is designed around precise temporal ordering and conflict resolution:
//!
//! ## Operation Types
//! Three fundamental operations are supported:
//! - **Insert**: Create new rows with specific RIDs
//! - **Update**: Modify existing row data while preserving RID
//! - **Delete**: Mark rows as deleted (soft deletion for RID stability)
//!
//! ## Temporal Ordering
//! All operations are timestamped with microsecond precision to enable deterministic
//! conflict resolution when multiple operations target the same RID. The system uses
//! a last-write-wins strategy based on these timestamps.
//!
//! ## Conflict Resolution
//! When operations conflict (multiple operations on the same RID), the system resolves
//! conflicts based on temporal ordering, with later timestamps taking precedence.
//!
//! # Usage Examples
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use crate::cilassembly::operation::{Operation, TableOperation};
//! use crate::metadata::tables::TableDataOwned;
//!
//! // Create operations
//! // let row_data = TableDataOwned::TypeDef(/* ... */);
//! // let insert_op = Operation::Insert(1, row_data);
//! // let delete_op = Operation::Delete(2);
//!
//! // Wrap with timestamps for conflict resolution
//! // let table_op = TableOperation::new(insert_op);
//!
//! // Check operation properties
//! // let rid = table_op.get_rid();
//! // let is_insert = table_op.is_insert();
//! ```
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! Both [`crate::cilassembly::operation::Operation`] and [`crate::cilassembly::operation::TableOperation`]
//! are [`Send`] and [`Sync`] as they contain only owned data and immutable timestamps.
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! This module integrates with:
//! - [`crate::cilassembly::modifications::TableModifications`] - Operation storage and application
//! - [`crate::cilassembly::validation`] - Operation validation and conflict detection
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables`] - Table data structures and row types

/// Specific operation types that can be applied to table rows.
///
/// This enum defines the three fundamental operations supported by the assembly modification
/// system. Each operation targets a specific RID (Row ID) and maintains referential integrity
/// through the validation system. Operations are typically wrapped in [`crate::cilassembly::operation::TableOperation`]
/// for timestamp-based conflict resolution.
///
/// # Operation Types
///
/// - **Insert**: Add a new row with a specific RID and data
/// - **Update**: Modify an existing row's data while preserving the RID
/// - **Delete**: Mark a row as deleted (soft deletion for RID stability)
///
/// # Usage Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use crate::cilassembly::operation::Operation;
/// use crate::metadata::tables::TableDataOwned;
///
/// // Create different operation types
/// // let row_data = TableDataOwned::TypeDef(/* ... */);
/// // let insert = Operation::Insert(1, row_data);
/// // let update = Operation::Update(1, updated_data);
/// // let delete = Operation::Delete(1);
///
/// // Check operation properties
/// // let rid = insert.get_rid();
/// // let op_type = insert.operation_type();
/// // let data = insert.get_row_data();
/// ```
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// This type is [`Send`] and [`Sync`] as it contains only owned data
/// with no interior mutability.
