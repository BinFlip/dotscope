//! .NET declarative security type definitions and security action enumerations.
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive type definitions for analyzing .NET's Code Access Security (CAS)
//! system, including security actions, permission argument types, and security permission flags.
//! These types support the parsing and analysis of declarative security attributes stored in
//! .NET assembly metadata.
//!
//! # .NET Security Architecture
//!
//! The .NET security system uses several key concepts that are represented by the types in this module:
//!
//! 1. **Security Actions**: Control how permissions are enforced (Demand, Assert, Deny, etc.)
//! 2. **Permission Arguments**: Typed values that configure individual permissions
//! 3. **Security Permission Flags**: Bitflags controlling access to security-sensitive operations
//! 4. **Permission Set Formats**: Different serialization formats for permission collections
//!
//! ## Security Action Enforcement
//!
//! Security actions determine when and how the CLR enforces permission checks:
//!
//! - **Runtime Actions**: `Demand`, `Assert`, `Deny`, `PermitOnly` (checked during execution)
//! - **Link-Time Actions**: `LinkDemand`, `InheritanceDemand` (checked during JIT compilation)
//! - **Assembly Request Actions**: `RequestMinimum`, `RequestOptional`, `RequestRefuse` (legacy)
//!
//! # Common Use Cases
//!
//! ## Security Action Analysis
//!
//! ```rust
//! use dotscope::metadata::security::{SecurityAction, Security};
//!
//! # fn analyze_security_action(security: &Security) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! match security.action {
//!     SecurityAction::Demand => {
//!         println!("Runtime permission demand - callers must have permission");
//!     },
//!     SecurityAction::LinkDemand => {
//!         println!("Link-time demand - immediate caller must have permission");
//!     },
//!     SecurityAction::Assert => {
//!         println!("Permission assertion - bypasses caller checks");
//!     },
//!     SecurityAction::Deny => {
//!         println!("Permission denial - blocks access regardless of grants");
//!     },
//!     SecurityAction::PermitOnly => {
//!         println!("Permit only - restricts to specified permissions");
//!     },
//!     _ => println!("Other security action: {:?}", security.action),
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Permission Argument Analysis
//!
//! ```rust
//! use dotscope::metadata::security::{ArgumentType, ArgumentValue};
//!
//! # fn analyze_permission_argument(arg_type: &ArgumentType, arg_value: &ArgumentValue) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! match (arg_type, arg_value) {
//!     (ArgumentType::String, ArgumentValue::String(path)) => {
//!         println!("String argument: {}", path);
//!     },
//!     (ArgumentType::Boolean, ArgumentValue::Boolean(flag)) => {
//!         println!("Boolean argument: {}", flag);
//!     },
//!     (ArgumentType::Enum(enum_type), ArgumentValue::Enum(_, value)) => {
//!         println!("Enum argument: {} = {}", enum_type, value);
//!     },
//!     (ArgumentType::Array(_), ArgumentValue::Array(values)) => {
//!         println!("Array argument with {} elements", values.len());
//!         for (i, value) in values.iter().enumerate() {
//!             println!("  [{}]: {}", i, value);
//!         }
//!     },
//!     _ => println!("Other argument type/value combination"),
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Security Permission Flag Analysis  
//!
//! ```rust
//! use dotscope::metadata::security::SecurityPermissionFlags;
//!
//! # fn analyze_security_flags(flags: SecurityPermissionFlags) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // Check for dangerous permissions
//! if flags.contains(SecurityPermissionFlags::SECURITY_FLAG_SKIP_VERIFICATION) {
//!     println!("WARNING: Can skip code verification");
//! }
//!
//! if flags.contains(SecurityPermissionFlags::SECURITY_FLAG_UNSAFE_CODE) {
//!     println!("WARNING: Can execute unsafe code");
//! }
//!
//! if flags.contains(SecurityPermissionFlags::SECURITY_FLAG_CONTROL_POLICY) {
//!     println!("WARNING: Can modify security policy");
//! }
//!
//! // Check for common permissions
//! if flags.contains(SecurityPermissionFlags::SECURITY_FLAG_EXECUTION) {
//!     println!("Can execute code (basic permission)");
//! }
//!
//! if flags.contains(SecurityPermissionFlags::SECURITY_FLAG_ASSERTION) {
//!     println!("Can assert permissions");
//! }
//!
//! println!("Security flags: 0x{:08X}", flags.bits());
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Permission Class Identification
//!
//! ```rust
//! use dotscope::metadata::security::security_classes;
//!
//! # fn identify_permission_class(class_name: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! match class_name {
//!     security_classes::FILE_IO_PERMISSION => {
//!         println!("File I/O permission detected");
//!     },
//!     security_classes::SECURITY_PERMISSION => {
//!         println!("Security permission detected");
//!     },
//!     security_classes::REGISTRY_PERMISSION => {
//!         println!("Registry permission detected");
//!     },
//!     security_classes::REFLECTION_PERMISSION => {
//!         println!("Reflection permission detected");
//!     },
//!     _ => println!("Unknown or custom permission: {}", class_name),
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Permission Set Formats
//!
//! .NET has used different serialization formats for permission sets over time:
//!
//! ## XML Format
//! Used in security policy files and some assembly attributes:
//! ```xml
//! <PermissionSet class="System.Security.PermissionSet" version="1">
//!   <IPermission class="System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermission" version="1">
//!     <Read>C:\Data</Read>
//!   </IPermission>
//! </PermissionSet>
//! ```
//!
//! ## Binary Formats
//! - **Legacy Binary**: Older .NET Framework format with simple binary encoding
//! - **Compressed Binary**: Newer format using compressed integers and optimized layout
//!
//! # Security Action Evolution
//!
//! The .NET security model has evolved significantly:
//!
//! ## .NET Framework 1.0-3.5
//! - Full CAS implementation with all security actions
//! - Assembly-level security requests (`RequestMinimum`, `RequestOptional`, `RequestRefuse`)
//! - Extensive use of link-time and inheritance demands
//!
//! ## .NET Framework 4.0+
//! - Security transparency model
//! - Many CAS features deprecated or simplified
//! - Introduction of "choice" security actions for transparent code
//!
//! ## .NET Core/.NET 5+
//! - Most CAS features removed or become no-ops
//! - Focus shifted to other security mechanisms
//! - Legacy support for analysis of older assemblies
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! All types in this module are safe to share across threads:
//! - Enums and bitflags are Copy types
//! - Argument values are immutable after creation
//! - String data is owned or reference-counted
//!
//! # ECMA-335 Compliance
//!
//! This implementation follows ECMA-335 specifications for declarative security:
//! - **Partition II, Section 22.11**: `DeclSecurity` table format
//! - **Partition II, Section 23.1.16**: Security action values
//! - **Partition I, Section 10**: Security model overview

/// # Action Categories

/// - [`Deny`](SecurityAction::Deny): Block access to the specified resource
/// - [`PermitOnly`](SecurityAction::PermitOnly): Allow only the specified permissions
///
/// ## Link-Time Actions

/// - [`LinkDemand`](SecurityAction::LinkDemand): Check the immediate caller only
/// - [`InheritanceDemand`](SecurityAction::InheritanceDemand): Check classes that inherit or override
///
/// ## Assembly Request Actions (Legacy)
/// Actions used for assembly-level permission requests (obsolete in modern .NET):
/// - [`RequestMinimum`](SecurityAction::RequestMinimum): Minimum required permissions
/// - [`RequestOptional`](SecurityAction::RequestOptional): Optional permissions to grant
/// - [`RequestRefuse`](SecurityAction::RequestRefuse): Permissions to refuse
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use dotscope::metadata::security::SecurityAction;
///
/// // Check if an action is runtime-enforced
/// fn is_runtime_action(action: SecurityAction) -> bool {
///     matches!(action,

///         SecurityAction::Assert |
///         SecurityAction::Deny |
///         SecurityAction::PermitOnly

///
/// ## XML Format (.NET 1.0+)

///
/// ## Binary Legacy (.NET 1.0-2.0)
/// An early binary format that provided more compact storage than XML but used
/// straightforward binary encoding without compression. This format was used in
/// early versions of declarative security attributes.
///
/// ## Binary Compressed (.NET 2.0+)
/// A more efficient binary format introduced to reduce metadata size. Uses compressed
/// integers, optimized encoding for common permission types, and other space-saving
/// techniques while maintaining compatibility with the security model.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use dotscope::metadata::security::PermissionSetFormat;
///
/// fn analyze_format_characteristics(format: &PermissionSetFormat) {
///     match format {
///         PermissionSetFormat::Xml => {
///             println!("Human-readable, verbose, used in policy files");
///         },
///         PermissionSetFormat::BinaryLegacy => {
///             println!("Compact, early binary format, limited compression");
///         },
///         PermissionSetFormat::BinaryCompressed => {
///             println!("Highly compact, compressed binary format, modern");
///         },
///         PermissionSetFormat::Unknown => {
///             println!("Unrecognized format, may be custom or corrupted");
///         },
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Format Detection
///
/// The format is typically detected by examining the first few bytes of the
/// permission set data:
/// - XML format starts with '<' character or XML declaration
/// - Binary formats have specific magic numbers or headers
/// - Unknown formats don't match any recognized pattern
///
/// # Compatibility Considerations
///
/// Different .NET runtime versions have varying support for these formats:
/// - **.NET Framework 1.0-3.5**: All formats supported
/// - **.NET Framework 4.0+**: All formats supported but CAS deprecated
/// - **.NET Core/.NET 5+**: Limited support, mainly for compatibility analysis
