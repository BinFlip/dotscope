//! Owned FieldPtr structures for the FieldPtr metadata table.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::fieldptr::owned::FieldPtr`] struct which represents field pointer
//! definitions with resolved references and owned data. Field pointers provide
//! an indirection mechanism for Field table access when logical and physical
//! field ordering differs.
//!
//! # Purpose
//! The FieldPtr table serves as an optimization mechanism in specific scenarios:
//! - **Field reordering**: When physical field layout differs from logical declaration order
//! - **Metadata optimization**: Reducing overall metadata size through strategic organization
//! - **Edit-and-continue**: Supporting field additions without breaking existing references
//! - **Incremental compilation**: Maintaining stable field references across builds
//! - **Compressed metadata**: Optimizing field access patterns in compressed streams
//!
//! # Indirection Mechanism
//! When FieldPtr table is present, field resolution follows this pattern:
//! - **Logical index**: The index used in source code and IL
//! - **FieldPtr entry**: Maps logical to physical index
//! - **Physical index**: Actual Field table entry location
//!
//! # ECMA-335 Reference
//! See ECMA-335, Partition II, §22.18 for the FieldPtr table specification.

/// Represents a field pointer with resolved references and owned data.
///
/// A field pointer provides indirection for field access, mapping logical field
/// indexes to physical Field table entries. This indirection is used when the
/// logical field order (as seen in source code) differs from the physical
/// storage order in metadata tables.
///
/// # Indirection Context
/// Field pointers are used in optimization scenarios:
/// - **Field reordering**: Physical layout optimization for cache efficiency
/// - **Metadata compression**: Strategic field organization to reduce metadata size
/// - **Incremental compilation**: Stable references during development iterations
/// - **Edit-and-continue**: Adding fields without breaking existing references
/// - **Platform optimization**: Field ordering based on target platform characteristics
