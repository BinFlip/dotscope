//! Raw `FieldPtr` structures for the `FieldPtr` metadata table.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::fieldptr::raw::FieldPtrRaw`] struct for reading field pointer data
//! directly from metadata tables before index resolution. The `FieldPtr` table provides
//! an indirection mechanism for Field table access when logical and physical field
//! ordering differs.
//!
//! # Table Structure
//! The `FieldPtr` table (`TableId` = 0x03) contains a single column:
//! - `Field`: Index into Field table for the actual field definition
//!
//! # Indirection Purpose
//! The `FieldPtr` table enables field access optimization:
//! - **Field reordering**: Physical layout differs from logical declaration order
//! - **Metadata optimization**: Strategic field organization to reduce metadata size
//! - **Edit-and-continue**: Supporting field additions without breaking references
//! - **Incremental compilation**: Maintaining stable field references
//! - **Platform optimization**: Field ordering based on target characteristics
//!
//! # ECMA-335 Reference
//! See ECMA-335, Partition II, §22.18 for the `FieldPtr` table specification.

/// Raw field pointer data read directly from the `FieldPtr` metadata table.
///
/// This structure represents a field pointer entry before index resolution and
/// processing. Field pointers provide indirection for field access when the
/// logical field order differs from the physical storage order in metadata.
///
/// # Binary Format
/// Each row in the `FieldPtr` table has this layout:
/// ```text
/// Offset | Size | Field | Description
/// -------|------|-------|----------------------------------
/// 0      | 2/4  | Field | Field table index
/// ```
///
/// The Field index size depends on the number of entries in the Field table.
///
/// # Indirection Mechanism
/// The `FieldPtr` table provides a mapping layer:
/// - **Logical index**: The RID of the `FieldPtr` entry (used in references)
/// - **Physical index**: The Field value pointing to actual Field table entry
/// - **Resolution**: `FieldPtr[logical] → Field[physical]`
///
