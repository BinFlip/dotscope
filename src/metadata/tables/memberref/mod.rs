//! `MemberRef` table implementation for external member references.
//!
//! This module provides complete support for the `MemberRef` metadata table, which defines
//! references to members (fields and methods) in external assemblies or modules. The `MemberRef`
//! table is essential for cross-assembly interoperability, late binding, and dynamic member
//! access in .NET applications.
//!
//! # Module Components
//! - [`MemberRefRaw`] - Raw table structure with unresolved coded indexes and heap references
//! - [`MemberRef`] - Owned variant with resolved references and parsed signatures
//! - [`MemberRefLoader`] - Internal loader for processing table entries (crate-private)
//! - [`MemberRefSignature`] - Union type for method and field signature representations
//! - Type aliases for collections: [`MemberRefMap`], [`MemberRefList`], [`MemberRefRc`]
//!
//! # Table Structure (ECMA-335 ยง22.25)
//! | Column | Type | Description |
//! |--------|------|-------------|
//! | Class | `MemberRefParent` coded index | Declaring type or module reference |
//! | Name | String heap index | Member name identifier |
//! | Signature | Blob heap index | Member signature (method or field) |
//!
//! # Member Reference Types
//! The `MemberRef` table supports references to different kinds of external members:
//! - **Field references**: External field access with type information and metadata
//! - **Method references**: External method calls with parameter and return type signatures
//! - **Constructor references**: Object creation with parameter specifications
//! - **Generic member references**: Generic methods and fields with type parameter resolution
//! - **Vararg method references**: Variable argument method calls with parameter lists
//!
//! # Parent Reference Types
//! The Class column uses `MemberRefParent` coded index encoding to specify the declaring context:
//! - **`TypeDef`**: Members declared in the current assembly's types
//! - **`TypeRef`**: Members declared in external assembly types
//! - **`ModuleRef`**: Global members declared in external modules
//! - **`MethodDef`**: Vararg method signatures referencing specific method definitions
//! - **`TypeSpec`**: Members of generic type instantiations
//!
//! # Signature Resolution
//! Member signatures in the blob heap are parsed according to their type:
//! - **Method signatures**: Include calling convention, parameter count, return type, and parameter types
//! - **Field signatures**: Include field type information and modifiers
//! - **Generic signatures**: Include type parameter specifications and constraints
//! - **Vararg signatures**: Include fixed and variable parameter specifications
//!
//! # ECMA-335 References
//! - ECMA-335, Partition II, ยง22.25: `MemberRef` table specification
//! - ECMA-335, Partition II, ยง23.2.6: `MemberRefParent` coded index encoding
//! - ECMA-335, Partition II, ยง23.2: Method and field signature specifications
