//! Owned FieldLayout structures for the FieldLayout metadata table.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::fieldlayout::owned::FieldLayout`] struct which represents field layout
//! definitions with resolved references and owned data. Field layouts specify
//! the explicit byte offset of fields within types that use explicit layout.
//!
//! # Purpose
//! The FieldLayout table is used when precise control over field positioning is needed:
//! - **Interop scenarios**: Matching native struct layouts for P/Invoke
//! - **Performance optimization**: Controlling memory layout for cache efficiency
//! - **Platform compatibility**: Ensuring consistent layouts across architectures
//! - **Legacy compatibility**: Matching existing binary data formats
//!
//! # Layout Types
//! - **Sequential**: Default .NET layout (no FieldLayout entries needed)
//! - **Explicit**: Programmer-specified field offsets (requires FieldLayout entries)
//! - **Auto**: Runtime-optimized layout (no FieldLayout entries)
//!
//! # ECMA-335 Reference
//! See ECMA-335, Partition II, ยง22.16 for the FieldLayout table specification.

/// Represents a field layout definition with resolved references and owned data.

/// A field layout specifies the explicit byte offset of a field within its containing
/// type. This is used when types have explicit layout attributes that require precise
/// control over field positioning in memory.
///
/// # Field Layout Context
/// Field layouts are only present for types that use explicit layout:
/// - **StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)**: C# structs with explicit field positioning
/// - **Interop types**: Types designed for P/Invoke or COM interop
/// - **Performance-critical types**: Types optimized for specific memory access patterns
///
/// # ECMA-335 Reference
/// See ECMA-335, Partition II, ยง22.16 for the complete FieldLayout table specification.
