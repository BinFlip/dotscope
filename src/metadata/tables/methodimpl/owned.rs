/// Owned `MethodImpl` table entry with resolved references and implementation mappings.

/// This structure represents a method implementation mapping with all coded indexes resolved
/// to their target structures and type references established. It provides complete
/// implementation mapping information for interface implementation, method overriding,
/// and virtual dispatch support in object-oriented programming.
///
/// # Implementation Mapping Types
/// `MethodImpl` entries support various implementation scenarios:
/// - **Interface implementation**: Maps interface method declarations to concrete class implementations
/// - **Virtual method override**: Specifies derived class methods that override base class methods
/// - **Explicit interface implementation**: Handles explicit implementation of interface members
/// - **Abstract method implementation**: Connects abstract declarations to concrete implementations
pub struct MethodImpl {
    /// Row identifier within the `MethodImpl` table.
    ///
    /// Unique identifier for this method implementation mapping entry, used for internal
    /// table management and cross-references.

    ///
    /// The token enables efficient lookup and reference to this implementation mapping
    /// from other metadata structures and runtime systems.

    /// This method establishes bidirectional relationships between method declarations
    /// and their implementations, updating both the implementing class and the declared
    /// method with cross-reference information. This enables efficient method resolution
    /// during virtual dispatch and interface member lookup operations.
    ///
    /// # Implementation Updates
    /// The method performs the following type system updates:
    /// - **Class overwrites**: Adds the method body to the class's overwrite collection
    /// - **Interface implementations**: Adds the implementation to the declaration's interface implementations
    /// - **Bidirectional linking**: Establishes cross-references for efficient lookup
    ///
    /// # Method Resolution Support
    /// These relationships enable sophisticated method resolution:
    /// - **Virtual dispatch**: Runtime can locate correct implementation for virtual calls
    /// - **Interface casting**: Interface method calls can be resolved to concrete implementations
    /// - **Reflection support**: Runtime reflection can discover implementation relationships
    /// - **Debugging information**: Development tools can trace method implementation chains
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `Ok(())` - If the implementation mapping was applied successfully
    /// * `Err(_)` - If updating type system relationships fails (currently infallible)
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns an error if updating type system relationships fails (currently infallible).
