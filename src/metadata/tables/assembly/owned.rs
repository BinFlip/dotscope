/// Represents a .NET CIL assembly with fully resolved metadata and owned data
///
/// This structure contains the complete assembly identity information from the Assembly
/// metadata table (0x20), with all heap references resolved to owned strings and byte arrays.
/// Unlike [`crate::metadata::tables::assembly::raw::AssemblyRaw`], this provides
/// immediate access to string data without requiring heap lookups.

/// # Assembly Identity
///
/// An assembly's identity consists of:
/// - **Simple name**: The filename without extension (e.g., "System.Core")
/// - **Version**: Four-part version number (Major.Minor.Build.Revision)
/// - **Culture**: Localization culture (None for culture-neutral assemblies)
/// - **Public key**: Strong name public key for verification (optional)
///
