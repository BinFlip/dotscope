//! Assembly table module
//!
//! Provides complete support for the ECMA-335 Assembly metadata table (0x20), which contains
//! the identity and versioning information for the current assembly. This module includes
//! raw table access, resolved data structures, and collection types.
//!
//! # Components
//!
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assembly::AssemblyRaw`]: Raw table structure with unresolved heap indexes
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assembly::Assembly`]: Owned variant with resolved strings/blobs and full metadata
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assembly::loader::AssemblyLoader`]: Internal loader for processing Assembly table data
//! - Type aliases for efficient collections and reference management
//!
//! # Assembly Table Structure
//!
//! The Assembly table contains exactly one row (if present) with these fields:
//! - **`HashAlgId`**: Hash algorithm identifier (see [`crate::metadata::tables::assembly::AssemblyHashAlgorithm`])
//! - **Version**: Four-part version number (Major.Minor.Build.Revision)
//! - **Flags**: Assembly attributes (see [`crate::metadata::tables::assembly::AssemblyFlags`])
//! - **`PublicKey`**: Strong name public key for assembly verification
//! - **Name**: Simple assembly name (e.g., "System.Core")
//! - **Culture**: Localization culture (empty for culture-neutral assemblies)
//!
//! # Reference
//! - [ECMA-335 II.22.2](https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-335_6th_edition_june_2012.pdf) - Assembly table specification
