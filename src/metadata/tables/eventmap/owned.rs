//! Owned EventMap table representation.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::eventmap::owned::EventMapEntry`] struct
//! for working with resolved EventMap metadata with owned data and resolved cross-references.
//! This represents the processed form of EventMap entries after raw table data has been converted
//! and all heap references have been resolved during the dual variant resolution phase.
//!
//! # EventMap Entry Structure
//!
//! Each EventMap entry establishes ownership between a type and a contiguous range
//! of events. The entry contains:
//! - **Parent Type**: Resolved reference to the type that owns the events
//! - **Event List**: Collection of events belonging to the parent type
//! - **Metadata**: Row identifier, token, and offset information
//!
//! # Reference
