//! Raw `ImportScope` table representation for Portable PDB format
//!
//! This module provides the [`ImportScopeRaw`] struct that represents
//! the binary format of `ImportScope` table entries as they appear in
//! the metadata tables stream. This is the low-level representation used during
//! the initial parsing phase, containing unresolved heap indices.
