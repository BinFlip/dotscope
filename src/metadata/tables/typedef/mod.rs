//! TypeDef metadata table support for .NET assemblies.
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive support for the `TypeDef` metadata table (ID 0x02), which
//! defines all types (classes, interfaces, value types, enums, delegates) within the current
//! assembly. The `TypeDef` table is fundamental to the .NET type system and serves as the primary
//! source of type definitions for metadata consumers.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The module is built around the ECMA-335 TypeDef table structure, providing both raw
//! table access and processed type representations. The architecture supports efficient
//! type lookups, member enumeration, and integration with the broader type system.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeDefRaw`] - Raw table entry representation
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::loader::TypeDefLoader`] - Table loading functionality  
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes`] - Type attribute flag constants
//!
//! # Table Structure
//!
//! The `TypeDef` table contains the following columns as specified in ECMA-335:
//! - **Flags** (4-byte bitmask): [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes`] controlling visibility, layout, and semantics
//! - **`TypeName`** (string heap index): Simple name of the type (without namespace)
//! - **`TypeNamespace`** (string heap index): Namespace containing the type (empty for global types)
//! - **`Extends`** (coded index): Base type reference (`TypeDef`, `TypeRef`, or `TypeSpec`)
//! - **`FieldList`** (Field table index): First field belonging to this type
//! - **`MethodList`** (`MethodDef` table index): First method belonging to this type
//!
//! # Type System Integration
//!
//! `TypeDef` entries are processed and converted into [`crate::metadata::typesystem::CilType`]
//! instances that provide high-level type system operations:
//! - Type hierarchy navigation and inheritance resolution
//! - Member enumeration (fields, methods, properties, events)
//! - Generic type parameter and constraint handling
//! - Custom attribute association and retrieval
//!
//! # Usage Examples
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use dotscope::metadata::tables::TypeAttributes;
//!
//! // Check if a type is public
//! let flags = 0x00000001; // PUBLIC flag
//! let is_public = (flags & TypeAttributes::VISIBILITY_MASK) == TypeAttributes::PUBLIC;
//! assert!(is_public);
//!
//! // Check if a type is abstract
//! let is_abstract = (flags & TypeAttributes::ABSTRACT) != 0;
//! # Ok::<(), dotscope::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! All types in this module are [`std::marker::Send`] and [`std::marker::Sync`] as they contain
//! only primitive data and static references. Type attribute constants are safe to share
//! across threads without synchronization.
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! This module integrates with:
//! - [`crate::metadata::typesystem`] - Provides processed type representations
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables`] - Part of the broader metadata table system
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::field`] - Related field definitions
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::methoddef`] - Related method definitions
//!
//! ## ECMA-335 Reference
//!
//! See ECMA-335, Partition II, Section 22.37 for the complete `TypeDef` table specification.
//!
//! **Table ID**: `0x02`

/// Type attribute flag constants for `TypeDef` entries.
///
/// This module provides all the flag constants used in the `TypeDef.Flags` field
/// to control type visibility, layout, semantics, and interoperability characteristics.
/// The flags are organized into logical groups with corresponding mask constants
/// for efficient bit manipulation.
///
/// ## Visibility Flags
/// Control type accessibility and nested type visibility:
/// - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::NOT_PUBLIC`] / [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::PUBLIC`] - Top-level type visibility
/// - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::NESTED_PUBLIC`], [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::NESTED_PRIVATE`], etc. - Nested type accessibility levels
///
/// ## Layout Flags  
/// Control how type fields are arranged in memory:
/// - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::AUTO_LAYOUT`] - Runtime-determined field layout (default)
/// - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::SEQUENTIAL_LAYOUT`] - Fields laid out in declaration order
/// - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::EXPLICIT_LAYOUT`] - Explicit field offsets specified
///
/// ## Semantic Flags
/// Control type behavior and characteristics:
/// - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::CLASS`] / [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::INTERFACE`] - Type category
/// - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::ABSTRACT`] / [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::SEALED`] - Inheritance modifiers
/// - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::SPECIAL_NAME`] / [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::IMPORT`] / [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::SERIALIZABLE`] - Special attributes
///
/// ## Interop Flags
/// Control string handling for native interoperability:
/// - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::ANSI_CLASS`] / [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::UNICODE_CLASS`] / [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::AUTO_CLASS`] - String encoding
/// - [`crate::metadata::tables::typedef::TypeAttributes::CUSTOM_FORMAT_CLASS`] - Custom string format
