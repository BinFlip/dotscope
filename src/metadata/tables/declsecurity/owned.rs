//! Owned `DeclSecurity` table representation.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::declsecurity::DeclSecurity`] struct
//! which contains fully resolved security declaration metadata with owned data and resolved references.
//! This is the primary data structure for representing .NET Code Access Security (CAS) declarations
//! in a usable form after the dual variant resolution phase.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::declsecurity::DeclSecurity`] - Main struct representing resolved security declarations
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! All types in this module are [`Send`] and [`Sync`], enabling safe sharing
//! across threads through reference counting and immutable data structures.

/// Represents a .NET CIL security declaration with fully resolved metadata and owned data
///
/// This structure contains complete security declaration information from the `DeclSecurity`

/// provides immediate access to security data without requiring additional lookups.
///
/// # .NET Code Access Security
///
/// Security declarations in .NET implement Code Access Security (CAS), which allows code
/// to declaratively specify required permissions or security restrictions. Declarations
/// are applied at three levels:
///
/// 1. **Assembly Level**: Applied to the entire assembly, often to request minimum permissions
/// 2. **Type Level**: Applied to a class or interface, affecting all its members  
/// 3. **Method Level**: Applied to a specific method for fine-grained control
///
/// # Security Actions
///
/// Security declarations specify how permissions are enforced:
/// - **Demand**: Code must have the specified permission to execute
/// - **Assert**: Code temporarily elevates permissions for trusted operations
/// - **Deny**: Code cannot use the specified permission, even if granted
/// - **`LinkDemand`**: Direct callers must have the permission (compile-time check)
/// - **`InheritanceDemand`**: Classes inheriting from this type must have permission
///
