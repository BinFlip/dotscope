//! Raw `AssemblyOS` table representation.
//!
//! This module provides low-level access to `AssemblyOS` metadata table data through the
//! [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyos::raw::AssemblyOsRaw`] structure. The `AssemblyOS` table
//! contains operating system targeting information for .NET assemblies, though it is rarely
//! used in modern applications.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Unlike other metadata tables that require heap resolution, `AssemblyOS` contains only primitive
//! integer values, making the "raw" and "owned" representations functionally identical. This
//! simplifies the dual variant pattern used throughout the metadata system.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyos::raw::AssemblyOsRaw`] - Raw table row structure
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyos::AssemblyOsRc`] - Reference-counted owned representation
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::types::RowReadable`] - Table parsing interface implementation
//!
//! # `AssemblyOS` Table Format
//!
//! The `AssemblyOS` table (0x22) contains operating system targeting information:
//! - **`OSPlatformId`** (4 bytes): Operating system platform identifier
//! - **`OSMajorVersion`** (4 bytes): Major version number of the target OS
//! - **`OSMinorVersion`** (4 bytes): Minor version number of the target OS
//!
//! # Historical Context
//!
//! This table was designed for early .NET Framework scenarios where assemblies might
//! need explicit OS compatibility declarations. Modern .NET applications typically
//! rely on runtime platform abstraction instead of metadata-level OS targeting.
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! This module integrates with:
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables`] - Core metadata table infrastructure
//! - [`crate::metadata::token`] - Token representation for metadata references
//! - [`crate::file::io`] - Binary data reading utilities
//!
//! # References
//!
