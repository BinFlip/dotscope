//! # `StandAloneSig` Owned Implementation
//!
//! This module provides the owned variant of `StandAloneSig` table entries with resolved
//! references and complete metadata context for application use.

use crate::metadata::{customattributes::CustomAttributeValueList, token::Token};

/// Owned representation of a `StandAloneSig` table entry with complete metadata context.
///
/// This structure represents a fully processed entry from the `StandAloneSig` metadata table
/// (ID 0x11), which contains standalone signatures that are not directly associated with
/// specific methods, fields, or properties. It contains resolved signature data and
/// complete contextual information for signature analysis and usage.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// The `StandAloneSig` table serves multiple signature scenarios:
/// - **Method Signatures**: Standalone method pointer and delegate signatures
/// - **Local Variable Signatures**: Method local variable type declarations
/// - **Dynamic Signatures**: Runtime signature generation and manipulation
/// - **CIL Instruction Support**: Signatures referenced by CIL instructions
///
/// ## Owned vs Raw
///
/// This owned variant provides:
/// - Resolved signature blob data with parsed type information
/// - Complete custom attribute collections with resolved values
/// - Validated signature structure and type references
/// - Integration with the broader metadata resolution system
/// - High-level access methods for signature analysis operations
///
/// ## Signature Types
///
/// `StandAloneSig` entries can contain various signature types:
/// - **Method Signatures**: Function pointer signatures with calling conventions
/// - **Local Variable Signatures**: Local variable type declarations
/// - **Field Signatures**: Standalone field type specifications
/// - **Generic Signatures**: Generic type and method instantiation signatures
///

    /// information including calling conventions, parameter types, return types,
    /// and other signature-specific data. The blob format depends on the signature type.
