//! Owned `ClassLayout` table representation.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::classlayout::owned::ClassLayout`] struct
//! which contains fully resolved memory layout information for types with owned data and resolved
//! table references. This is the primary data structure for representing explicit class layout
//! information in a usable form after the dual variant resolution phase.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The owned representation stores fully resolved data from the `ClassLayout` metadata table,
//! including resolved references to type definitions. This eliminates the need for table
//! lookups during runtime access, providing immediate access to memory layout metadata.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::classlayout::owned::ClassLayout`] - Main owned layout structure
//! - [`crate::metadata::typesystem::CilTypeRc`] - Referenced type definition
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! This module integrates with:
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::classlayout::raw`] - Raw table representation
//! - [`crate::metadata::typesystem`] - Type system components
//! - [`crate::metadata::validation`] - Layout validation logic
//! - [`crate::metadata::token`] - Token-based metadata references

/// Represents explicit memory layout information for a .NET type
///
/// This structure contains the complete layout specification from the `ClassLayout`
/// metadata table (0x0F), with all table references resolved to owned type instances.
/// Unlike [`crate::metadata::tables::classlayout::raw::ClassLayoutRaw`], this provides
/// immediate access to the type data without requiring table lookups.
///
/// # Memory Layout Control
///
/// `ClassLayout` provides explicit control over type memory layout:
/// - **Field alignment**: `PackingSize` specifies byte boundary alignment for fields
/// - **Total size**: `ClassSize` can override automatic size calculation
/// - **Layout kind**: Works with Sequential and Explicit layout attributes
/// - **Interop support**: Enables precise control for native interoperability
///
/// # Usage Context
///
/// `ClassLayout` is primarily used for:
/// - **P/Invoke scenarios**: Matching native C/C++ struct layouts
/// - **Performance optimization**: Controlling cache alignment and padding
/// - **Binary compatibility**: Ensuring consistent layout across platforms
/// - **Custom marshalling**: Supporting specific serialization requirements
///
/// # Layout Validation
///
/// Layout parameters are validated during application to ensure:
/// - `PackingSize` is a power of 2 or 0 (for default)
/// - `ClassSize` is reasonable and not conflicting
/// - No duplicate layout specifications exist
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// This type is [`Send`] and [`Sync`]. All fields are read-only after construction and safe
/// for concurrent access. The `apply` method uses atomic operations when updating type
/// definition data.
///
