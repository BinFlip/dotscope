//! # `PropertyMap` Owned Implementation
//!
//! This module provides the owned variant of `PropertyMap` table entries with resolved
//! references and complete metadata context for application use.

use crate::{
    metadata::{tables::PropertyList, token::Token, typesystem::CilTypeRef},
    Result,
};

/// Owned representation of a `PropertyMap` table entry with complete metadata context.
///
/// This structure represents a fully processed entry from the `PropertyMap` metadata table
/// (ID 0x15), which establishes the relationship between types and their properties.
/// It contains resolved type and property references, enabling efficient property
/// enumeration and type-property binding operations.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// The `PropertyMap` table serves as the foundation for type-property relationships:
/// - **Type-Property Binding**: Links types to their associated properties
/// - **Property Enumeration**: Enables discovery of all properties for a given type
/// - **Inheritance Support**: Facilitates property inheritance and override resolution
/// - **Reflection Foundation**: Supports property-based reflection and metadata queries
///
/// ## Owned vs Raw
///
/// This owned variant provides:
/// - Resolved parent type references from the type system
/// - Complete property collections with resolved property entries
/// - Validated property-type relationships and constraints
/// - Integration with the broader metadata resolution system
/// - High-level access methods for property enumeration
///
/// ## References
