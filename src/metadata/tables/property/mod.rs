//! # Property Table Module
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive access to the Property metadata table (ID 0x17),
//! which defines properties exposed by types in .NET assemblies. Properties represent
//! named attributes that can be accessed through getter and setter methods, forming
//! a fundamental part of the .NET object model.
//!
//! ## Table Purpose
//!
//! The Property table provides:
//! - **Property Definitions**: Names, signatures, and attributes for type properties
//! - **Method Association**: Links properties to their getter/setter methods via `MethodSemantics`
//! - **Type Binding**: Associates properties with their declaring types through `PropertyMap`
//! - **Reflection Support**: Enables property-based reflection and metadata queries
//!
//! ## Module Structure
//!
//! The module follows the standard dual-variant pattern for metadata tables:
//!
//! ### Raw Variant (`PropertyRaw`)
//! - Direct memory representation of table entries
//! - Contains unresolved heap indexes for names and signatures
//! - Minimal processing overhead during initial parsing
//! - Used for memory-efficient storage and initial metadata loading
//!
//! ### Owned Variant (`Property`)
//! - Fully processed and validated table entries
//! - Contains resolved property names and parsed type signatures
//! - Provides high-level access methods and validation
//! - Used for application logic and metadata analysis
//!
//! ## Property Attributes
//!
//! Properties can have various attributes that control their behavior:
//! - **`SpecialName`**: Property has special naming conventions
//! - **`RTSpecialName`**: Runtime should verify name encoding
//! - **`HasDefault`**: Property has a default value defined
//!
//! ## References

//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::PropertyMap`] - Property to type mapping
