//! references and complete metadata context for application use.

/// Owned representation of a Property table entry with complete metadata context.
///
/// This structure represents a fully processed entry from the Property metadata table
/// (ID 0x17), which defines properties exposed by types in .NET assemblies. It contains
/// resolved names, parsed signatures, and lazy-loaded associated methods and values.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// The Property table serves as the foundation for .NET property system:
/// - **Property Definition**: Defines property names, types, and characteristics
/// - **Method Association**: Links to getter, setter, and other associated methods
/// - **Type Integration**: Integrates properties into the type system through PropertyMap
/// - **Reflection Support**: Enables property-based reflection and metadata queries
///
/// ## Owned vs Raw
///
/// This owned variant provides:
/// - Resolved property names from the string heap
/// - Parsed property signatures with complete type information
/// - Lazy-loaded associated methods and default values
/// - Custom attribute resolution and accessibility
/// - Integration with the broader metadata resolution system
///
/// ## Property Methods
///
/// Properties can be associated with various methods:
/// - **Getter**: Method that retrieves the property value (get_PropertyName)
/// - **Setter**: Method that sets the property value (set_PropertyName)
/// - **Other**: Additional methods related to property functionality
///
/// ## References
