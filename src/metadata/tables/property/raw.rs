#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
/// Raw representation of a Property table entry with unresolved indexes.
///
/// This structure represents the unprocessed entry from the Property metadata table
/// (ID 0x17), which defines properties exposed by types in .NET assemblies. It contains
/// raw index values that require resolution to actual metadata objects.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// The Property table provides the foundation for .NET property system:
/// - **Property Definition**: Defines property names, types, and characteristics
/// - **Type Integration**: Associates properties with their declaring types
/// - **Method Binding**: Links properties to getter/setter methods via `MethodSemantics`
/// - **Reflection Foundation**: Enables property-based reflection and metadata queries
///
/// ## Raw vs Owned
///
/// This raw variant is used during initial metadata parsing and contains:
/// - Unresolved string heap indexes requiring name lookup
/// - Unresolved blob heap indexes requiring signature parsing
/// - Minimal memory footprint for storage during parsing
/// - Direct representation of on-disk table structure
///
/// ## Property Attributes
///
/// Properties can have various attributes that control their behavior:
/// - **`SpecialName`**: Property has special naming conventions (0x0200)
/// - **`RTSpecialName`**: Runtime should verify name encoding (0x0400)
/// - **`HasDefault`**: Property has a default value defined (0x1000)
///
/// ## References
///
/// - ECMA-335, Partition II, §22.34 - Property table specification
/// - [`crate::metadata::tables::Property`] - Owned variant for comparison
/// - [`crate::metadata::tables::PropertyMap`] - Property to type mapping
/// - [`crate::metadata::signatures::SignatureProperty`] - Property signature details

    /// ## Arguments
    ///
    /// * `strings` - The string heap for name resolution
    /// * `blob` - The blob heap for signature parsing
    ///
    /// ## Returns
    ///
    /// * `Ok(PropertyRc)` - Successfully converted to owned representation
    /// * `Err(Error)` - String resolution or signature parsing error
    ///
    /// ## Errors
    ///
    /// * [`crate::error::Error::OutOfBounds`] - Invalid string or blob heap index
    /// * [`crate::error::Error::Malformed`] - Malformed property signature
