//! Field metadata table implementation.
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive support for the ECMA-335 Field metadata table (0x04),
//! which defines the fields (data members) that belong to types. Fields represent
//! the data storage structure of .NET types including instance fields, static fields,
//! constants, and literals with their associated types and characteristics. It includes raw
//! table access, resolved data structures, and integration with the broader metadata system.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! This module follows the dual variant pattern for metadata table representation:
//! - **Raw Layer**: [`crate::metadata::tables::field::raw::FieldRaw`] provides direct binary access
//! - **Owned Layer**: [`crate::metadata::tables::field::owned::Field`] offers resolved, validated data
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - **Raw Representation**: [`crate::metadata::tables::field::raw::FieldRaw`] - Direct binary table format with unresolved indexes
//! - **Owned Data**: [`crate::metadata::tables::field::owned::Field`] - Resolved entries with owned data and parsed signatures
//! - **Loading Infrastructure**: [`crate::metadata::tables::field::loader::FieldLoader`] - Processes raw entries during metadata loading
//! - **Type Aliases**: Collection types for managing Field entries efficiently
//! - **Attributes**: [`crate::metadata::tables::field::FieldAttributes`] module with field characteristic constants
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! - Raw entries are processed by [`crate::metadata::tables::field::loader::FieldLoader`] during metadata loading
//! - Integrates with [`crate::metadata::streams::Strings`] for name resolution and [`crate::metadata::streams::Blob`] for signature parsing
//! - References type definitions through field ownership relationships
//!
//! # Field Table Structure
//!
//! Each Field entry contains:
//! - **Flags** (2 bytes): Field attributes bitmask controlling access and behavior
//! - **Name** (2/4 bytes): String heap index for the field name
//! - **Signature** (2/4 bytes): Blob heap index for the field type signature
//!
//! Fields are owned by types and define the data storage layout, access patterns,
//! and type information for both instance and static data members.
//!
//! # Field Attributes
//!
//! The [`FieldAttributes`] module provides constants for field characteristics:
//! - **Access Control**: Private, public, family, assembly, etc.
//! - **Storage Type**: Instance vs. static storage
//! - **Mutability**: Read-only, literal, initialization-only
//! - **Special Behavior**: Marshaling, P/Invoke, RVA, serialization
//!
