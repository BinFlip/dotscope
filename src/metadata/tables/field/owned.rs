//! Owned Field structures for the Field metadata table.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::field::owned::Field`] struct which represents field definitions
//! with resolved references and owned data. Fields define the data members of types
//! in the `TypeDef` table, including instance fields, static fields, and literals.
//!
//! # ECMA-335 Reference
//! See ECMA-335, Partition II, §22.15 for the Field table specification.

/// marshalling information, and custom attributes.

/// - **Instance fields**: Non-static data members of a class or value type
/// - **Static fields**: Class-level data members shared across all instances
/// - **Literals**: Compile-time constants with default values
