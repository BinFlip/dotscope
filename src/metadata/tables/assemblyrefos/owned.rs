//! Owned AssemblyRefOS table representation.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyrefos::owned::AssemblyRefOs`] struct
//! which contains fully resolved operating system compatibility information for external assembly
//! references. This is the primary data structure for representing OS requirements for referenced
//! assemblies in a usable form after the dual variant resolution phase.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The owned representation stores fully resolved data from the AssemblyRefOS metadata table,
//! including resolved references to assembly dependencies. This eliminates the need for table
//! lookups during runtime access, providing immediate access to OS compatibility metadata.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyrefos::owned::AssemblyRefOs`] - Main owned OS compatibility structure
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyref::AssemblyRefRc`] - Referenced assembly dependency
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! This module integrates with:
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyrefos::raw`] - Raw table representation
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyref`] - Assembly reference table entries
//! - [`crate::metadata::token`] - Token-based metadata references

/// Represents operating system compatibility information for an external assembly reference
///
/// This structure contains OS targeting information from the AssemblyRefOS metadata table (0x25),
/// with all references resolved to owned data. Unlike [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyrefos::raw::AssemblyRefOsRaw`],
/// this provides immediate access to the referenced assembly without requiring table lookups.
///
/// # Operating System Targeting
///
/// The AssemblyRefOS table allows specifying explicit OS requirements for external assemblies:
/// - **Platform ID**: Operating system family identifier
/// - **Major Version**: Target OS major version number  
/// - **Minor Version**: Target OS minor version number
/// - **Assembly Reference**: The external assembly these requirements apply to
///
/// # Historical Context
///
/// This table is rarely used in modern .NET assemblies and is considered legacy. It was designed
/// for early .NET Framework scenarios where assemblies might need explicit OS compatibility
/// declarations. Modern .NET relies on runtime platform abstraction instead.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// This type is [`Send`] and [`Sync`]. All fields are read-only after construction and safe
/// for concurrent access. The `apply` method uses atomic operations when updating assembly
/// reference data.
