//! Owned `LocalScope` representation for resolved metadata access

//! This module provides the [`LocalScope`] struct which represents fully resolved
//! `LocalScope` table data with convenient access methods for scope analysis and
//! debugging support.

/// Owned representation of a `LocalScope` table entry with resolved references
///
/// This structure provides a fully resolved view of local scope information,
/// containing all necessary data for scope analysis and debugging operations.
/// Unlike the raw representation, this struct contains resolved references to
/// actual objects rather than table indices.
///
/// # Scope Analysis
///
/// `LocalScope` entries define the ranges where local variables and constants
/// are visible within method IL code. Each scope has:
/// - Clear start and end boundaries (IL offsets)
/// - Associated variables and constants (fully resolved)
/// - Import context for namespace resolution
/// - Reference to containing method
///
/// # Reference Resolution
///
/// All table indices have been resolved to their actual objects:
/// - `method`: Strong reference to the containing `MethodDef`
/// - `import_scope`: Optional strong reference to `ImportScope`
/// - `variables`: Complete vector of `LocalVariable` entries
/// - `constants`: Complete vector of `LocalConstant` entries
