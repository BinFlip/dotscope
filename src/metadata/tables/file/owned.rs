//! Owned File structures for the File metadata table.
//!
//! This module provides the [`File`] struct which represents file definitions
//! with resolved references and owned data. Files list the components of
//! multi-file assemblies including modules, resources, and native libraries.
//!
//! # Purpose
//! The File table enables multi-file assembly scenarios:
//! - **Multi-module assemblies**: Additional .netmodule files containing code
//! - **Resource files**: Binary data files (.resources, images, data)
//! - **Native libraries**: Unmanaged DLLs for P/Invoke operations
//! - **Documentation**: Associated help files and XML documentation
//! - **Satellite assemblies**: Localization and culture-specific resources
//!
//! # File Management
//! Files provide assembly composition information:
//! - **Component tracking**: Lists all files that comprise the assembly
//! - **Integrity verification**: Cryptographic hashes ensure file authenticity
//! - **Type classification**: Flags distinguish metadata from resource files
//! - **Reference resolution**: Names enable runtime file location
//!
//! # ECMA-335 Reference
//! See ECMA-335, Partition II, ยง22.19 for the File table specification.

/// Represents a file definition with resolved references and owned data.
///
/// A file entry describes a component of a multi-file assembly, providing metadata
/// about files that are part of the assembly but stored separately from the main
/// manifest. This includes modules, resources, and native libraries.
///
/// # File Types
/// Files can serve various purposes in assemblies:
/// - **Executable modules**: .netmodule files with executable code
/// - **Resource files**: .resources files with binary data
/// - **Native libraries**: .dll files with unmanaged code
/// - **Documentation**: .xml files with API documentation
/// - **Configuration**: Data files with application settings
///
/// # File Attributes
/// The flags field indicates file characteristics:
/// - **`CONTAINS_META_DATA`**: File contains .NET metadata (executable modules)
/// - **`CONTAINS_NO_META_DATA`**: Resource files without metadata
///
/// # Hash Verification
/// Each file includes a cryptographic hash for security:
/// - **SHA-1 or SHA-256**: Algorithm depends on assembly version
/// - **Integrity checking**: Verifies file hasn't been tampered with
/// - **Loading validation**: Runtime can verify file authenticity
/// - **Security assurance**: Prevents malicious file substitution
///
/// # Assembly Integration
/// Files integrate with the broader assembly structure:
/// - **Module loading**: Executable files loaded by the CLR
/// - **Resource access**: Resource files accessed through APIs
/// - **P/Invoke**: Native libraries used for interop
/// - **Documentation**: Help files displayed in IDEs
///
/// # ECMA-335 Reference
/// See ECMA-335, Partition II, ยง22.19 for the complete File table specification.
