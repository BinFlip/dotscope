//! `AssemblyProcessor` table module.
//!
//! This module provides complete support for the ECMA-335 `AssemblyProcessor` metadata table (0x21),
//! which contains processor architecture information for assemblies. It includes raw table access,
//! collection types, and CPU architecture identification utilities for processing processor
//! targeting metadata.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The `AssemblyProcessor` module follows the standard dual variant pattern but simplifies it since
//! the table contains only primitive values. No heap resolution is required, making the raw and
//! owned representations functionally identical.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyprocessor::raw::AssemblyProcessorRaw`] - Raw table structure
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyprocessor::AssemblyProcessor`] - Type alias to Raw
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyprocessor::loader::AssemblyProcessorLoader`] - Internal loader
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyprocessor::AssemblyProcessorMap`] - Token-based lookup map
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyprocessor::AssemblyProcessorList`] - Collection type
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyprocessor::AssemblyProcessorRc`] - Reference-counted pointer
//!
//! # `AssemblyProcessor` Table Structure
//!
//! The `AssemblyProcessor` table contains CPU architecture targeting information:
//! - **Processor**: Processor architecture identifier (4 bytes)
//!
//! # Historical Context
//!
//! This table was designed for early .NET Framework scenarios where assemblies might need
//! to specify explicit CPU architecture targeting. Modern .NET applications typically use
//! `AnyCPU` compilation and rely on runtime JIT compilation to optimize for the target architecture.
//!
//! # CPU Architecture Evolution
//!
//! - **Early .NET**: Explicit x86/x64/IA64 targeting via metadata
//! - **Modern .NET**: `AnyCPU` with runtime architecture detection
//! - **Current Practice**: Platform-agnostic IL with JIT optimization
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! This module integrates with:
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables`] - Core metadata table infrastructure
//! - [`crate::metadata::token`] - Token-based metadata references
//! - [`crate::metadata::loader`] - Metadata loading system
//!
//! # References
