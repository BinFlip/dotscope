//! EventPtr table module.
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive support for the ECMA-335 EventPtr metadata table (0x13),
//! which provides a level of indirection for event references. EventPtr tables are
//! typically present only in assemblies that have undergone edit-and-continue operations,
//! where the original event ordering may have been disrupted. It includes raw table access,
//! resolved data structures, and integration with the broader metadata system.
//!
//! # Components
//!
//! - **Raw Representation**: [`EventPtrRaw`] - Direct binary table format with unresolved indexes
//! - **Owned Data**: [`EventPtr`] - Resolved entries with owned data and direct event references
//! - **Loading Infrastructure**: [`EventPtrLoader`] - Processes raw entries during metadata loading
//! - **Type Aliases**: Collection types for managing EventPtr entries efficiently
//!
//! # EventPtr Table Structure
//!
//! Each EventPtr entry contains:
//! - **Event** (2/4 bytes): RID pointing to the actual event in the Event table
//!
//! The table provides a simple indirection mechanism where logical event indexes
//! map to physical event locations, allowing for non-contiguous event arrangements
//! while maintaining logical ordering.
//!
//! # Edit-and-Continue Support
//!
//! EventPtr tables are primarily used to support edit-and-continue scenarios:
//! - Original event table ordering may be disrupted during code modifications
//! - EventPtr provides stable logical indexes that map to potentially relocated events
//! - Enables maintaining consistent metadata references across edit sessions
//!
//! # Conditional Presence
//!
//! EventPtr tables are optional and only present when needed:
//! - **Not Present**: Direct event indexing is used (normal case)
//! - **Present**: Indirection through EventPtr is required (edit-and-continue case)
//!
//! # Reference
