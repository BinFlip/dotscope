//! Owned ExportedType entry representation.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::exportedtype::owned::ExportedType`] struct
//! for working with resolved ExportedType metadata with owned data and resolved cross-references.
//! This represents the processed form of ExportedType entries after raw table data has been
//! converted and all heap references have been resolved during the dual variant resolution phase.
//!
//! # ExportedType Entry Structure
//!
//! Each ExportedType entry defines a type that is exported from this assembly but
//! may be implemented elsewhere. The entry contains:
//! - **Type Identity**: Name, namespace, and flags defining the exported type
//! - **Implementation Reference**: Points to where the type is actually defined
//! - **Type Hints**: Optional TypeDef ID for resolution optimization
//! - **Custom Attributes**: Metadata annotations applied to the export
//!
//! # Export Scenarios
//!
//! ExportedType entries support several assembly composition patterns:
//! - **Type Forwarding**: Redirecting type references to different assemblies
//! - **Multi-Module**: Exposing types from different files within an assembly
//! - **Assembly Facades**: Creating simplified public interfaces over complex implementations
//!
//! # Reference
//! - [ECMA-335 II.22.14](https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-335_6th_edition_june_2012.pdf) - ExportedType table specification
