//! Raw `AssemblyRef` table representation.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyref::raw::AssemblyRefRaw`] struct
//! for low-level access to `AssemblyRef` metadata table data with unresolved heap indexes. This
//! represents the binary format of assembly reference records as they appear in the metadata
//! tables stream before heap resolution.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The raw representation stores data exactly as it appears in the metadata tables stream,
//! with heap indexes that require resolution through the string and blob heaps. This is
//! part of the dual variant pattern used throughout the metadata system.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyref::raw::AssemblyRefRaw`] - Raw table row structure
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyref::AssemblyRefRc`] - Reference-counted owned representation
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::RowDefinition`] - Table parsing interface implementation
//!
//! # `AssemblyRef` Table Format
//!
//! The `AssemblyRef` table (0x23) contains zero or more rows with these fields:
//! - **`MajorVersion`** (2 bytes): Major version number
//! - **`MinorVersion`** (2 bytes): Minor version number  
//! - **`BuildNumber`** (2 bytes): Build number
//! - **`RevisionNumber`** (2 bytes): Revision number
//! - **Flags** (4 bytes): Assembly flags bitmask
//! - **`PublicKeyOrToken`** (2/4 bytes): Blob heap index for public key/token data
//! - **Name** (2/4 bytes): String heap index for assembly name
//! - **Culture** (2/4 bytes): String heap index for culture name
//! - **`HashValue`** (2/4 bytes): Blob heap index for hash data
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! This module integrates with:
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables`] - Core metadata table infrastructure
//! - [`crate::metadata::streams`] - String and blob heap access
//! - [`crate::metadata::token`] - Token representation for metadata references
//! - [`crate::file::io`] - Binary data reading utilities
//!
//! # References
