//! `ManifestResource` table implementation for assembly resource management.
//!
//! This module provides complete support for the `ManifestResource` metadata table, which defines
//! resources embedded in or linked to .NET assemblies. The `ManifestResource` table is essential
//! for resource management, globalization, and access to non-code assets in .NET applications.
//!
//! # Module Components
//! - [`ManifestResourceRaw`] - Raw table structure with unresolved coded indexes
//! - [`ManifestResource`] - Owned variant with resolved references and resource data access
//! - [`ManifestResourceLoader`] - Internal loader for processing table entries (crate-private)
//! - [`ManifestResourceAttributes`] - Resource visibility and access control flags
//! - Type aliases for collections: [`ManifestResourceMap`], [`ManifestResourceList`], [`ManifestResourceRc`]
//!
//! # Table Structure (ECMA-335 ยง22.24)
//! | Column | Type | Description |
//! |--------|------|-------------|
//! | Offset | 4-byte offset | Location within resource data (0 for external) |
//! | Flags | 4-byte flags | Resource visibility attributes |
//! | Name | String heap index | Resource identifier name |
//! | Implementation | Implementation coded index | Location reference (null, File, or `AssemblyRef`) |
//!
//! # Resource Storage Models
//! The `ManifestResource` table supports multiple resource storage and access patterns:
//! - **Embedded resources**: Binary data stored directly in the assembly PE file
//! - **File-based resources**: External files referenced through the File table
//! - **Assembly-based resources**: Resources located in external assemblies via `AssemblyRef`
//! - **Satellite assemblies**: Culture-specific resources for internationalization
//! - **Streaming access**: Large resources accessed through streaming interfaces
//!
//! # Resource Visibility and Access
//! Resource access is controlled through [`ManifestResourceAttributes`]:
//! - **Public resources**: Accessible to external assemblies and runtime systems
//! - **Private resources**: Restricted to the declaring assembly's internal use
//! - **Assembly security**: Controlled access based on assembly trust levels
//!
