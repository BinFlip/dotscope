//! Owned `ManifestResource` table structure with resolved references and resource access.

//! This module provides the [`ManifestResource`] struct, which represents resource entries
//! with all references resolved and resource data access established. Unlike [`ManifestResourceRaw`],
//! this structure contains resolved implementation references, owned strings, and direct
//! access to resource data.

/// Owned `ManifestResource` table entry with resolved references and resource access.
///
/// This structure represents an assembly resource entry with all coded indexes resolved
/// to their target structures and resource data access established. It provides complete
/// resource metadata and enables runtime resource loading and access operations.
///
/// # Resource Storage Models
/// `ManifestResource` entries support different resource storage patterns:
/// - **Embedded resources**: Data stored directly in the current assembly PE file
/// - **File-based resources**: External files referenced through the File table
/// - **Assembly-based resources**: Resources located in external assemblies
/// - **Satellite resources**: Culture-specific resources for localization
pub struct ManifestResource {
    /// Row identifier within the `ManifestResource` table.
    ///
    /// Unique identifier for this resource entry, used for internal
    /// table management and cross-references.

    /// Metadata token identifying this `ManifestResource` entry.
    ///
    /// The token enables efficient lookup and reference to this resource
    /// from other metadata structures and runtime systems.

    ///

    /// relative to the resource section. For external resources, this value is 0 and
    /// the actual location is determined by the [`source`] reference.

    /// Size of the resource data in bytes.

    /// For embedded resources, this provides the exact data size for efficient reading.

    /// the external source (file or assembly).
