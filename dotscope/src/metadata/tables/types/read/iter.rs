//! Iterator implementations for sequential and parallel metadata table processing.
//!
//! This module provides iterator types that enable efficient traversal of metadata table rows
//! in both sequential and parallel modes. The iterators are designed to work seamlessly with
//! the Rust iterator ecosystem while providing specialized optimizations for metadata table
//! access patterns.
//!
//! ## Iterator Types
//!
//! - [`TableIterator`] - Sequential iterator for memory-efficient row-by-row processing
//! - [`TableParIterator`] - Parallel iterator leveraging Rayon for concurrent processing
//! - [`TableProducer`] - Internal work distribution for parallel iteration
//! - [`TableProducerIterator`] - Internal chunk processing for parallel iteration
//!
//! ## Design Goals
//!
//! The iterator design prioritizes:
//! - **Lazy evaluation**: Rows are parsed only when accessed, reducing memory usage
//! - **Error resilience**: Parse failures result in `None` rather than panics
//! - **Performance**: Optimal memory access patterns and parallel processing support
//!
//! ## Thread Safety
//!
//! All iterator types support concurrent access with appropriate safety guarantees:
//! - Sequential iterators are `Send` for thread transfer
//! - Parallel iterators require `Send + Sync` row types for safe concurrent processing
//! - Work-stealing algorithms ensure optimal load balancing across threads
//!
//! ## Related Modules
//!
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::types::read::table`] - Table container that creates iterators
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::types::read::traits`] - Core parsing traits
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::types::read::access`] - Low-level access utilities

/// Discards a row that could not be parsed, after logging it.
///
/// For consumers that genuinely cannot propagate — an adapter chain inside a function
/// returning `Option`, or a scan that has no error channel. Written as a named function
/// rather than `.flatten()` or `.filter_map(Result::ok)` so that dropping a row is greppable
/// and leaves a trace: a silently short table is how a malformed row turns into missing
/// analysis output rather than an error.
///
/// Prefer `?` wherever the caller can carry an error.
///
/// # Position is not RID
///
/// Dropping a row shifts everything after it, so **the position of a row in a filtered
/// sequence is not its RID**. Never derive a RID from `enumerate()`, an index into a
/// collected `Vec`, `.first()`, or `.next()`:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// // Wrong: one unreadable row ahead of the match names a different row entirely.
/// for (index, row) in table.iter().filter_map(skip_unreadable).enumerate() {
///     let rid = index as u32 + 1;
/// }
///
/// // Right: the row carries its own RID.
/// for row in table.iter().filter_map(skip_unreadable) {
///     let rid = row.rid;
/// }
///
/// // Right, when a specific RID is wanted: `get` derives each row's offset from its RID,
/// // so an unreadable row cannot displace any other.
/// let module = table.get(1).ok().flatten();
/// ```
///
/// Every raw row struct carries a `rid` field, and
/// [`MetadataTable::get`](super::MetadataTable::get) fetches by RID directly. This mattered
/// most where a row was read positionally and written back under the original RID, which
/// copied one row's contents onto a different row.

/// Sequential iterator for metadata table rows.
///
/// This iterator provides lazy, on-demand access to table rows in sequential order.
/// It maintains minimal state and parses rows only as they are requested, making
/// it memory-efficient for large tables.
///
/// ## Characteristics
///
/// - **Lazy evaluation**: Rows are parsed only when accessed
/// - **Memory efficient**: Constant memory usage regardless of table size
/// - **Honest about failure**: a row that does not parse is yielded as `Err`, not skipped
/// - **Cache friendly**: Sequential access pattern optimizes memory locality
///
/// ## Why the item type is a `Result`
///
/// Yielding `None` on a parse error would end the iteration, silently dropping every
/// remaining row — a row-hiding primitive on a hostile file, and one that reaches further
/// than it looks: the writer rebuilds tables by iterating them, so a table truncated this way
/// is re-emitted without the rows that were skipped. Every row is therefore reported, and the
/// iterator always yields exactly `row_count` items.

/// Parallel iterator for metadata table rows.
///
/// This iterator enables concurrent processing of table rows across multiple threads
/// using the Rayon parallel processing framework. It automatically distributes work
/// and handles synchronization, providing significant performance improvements for
/// CPU-intensive operations on large tables.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - **Automatic parallelization**: Work is distributed across available CPU cores
/// - **Load balancing**: Dynamic work stealing ensures optimal CPU utilization  
/// - **Error handling**: Built-in support for early termination on errors
/// - **Type safety**: Compile-time guarantees about thread safety requirements
///
/// ## Requirements
///
/// The row type `T` must implement `Send + Sync` to enable safe parallel processing.
/// This ensures that rows can be safely transferred between threads and accessed
/// concurrently.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Created through [`MetadataTable::par_iter()`] and supports all Rayon parallel
/// iterator operations
