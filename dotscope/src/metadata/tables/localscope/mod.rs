//! `LocalScope` table implementation for Portable PDB format
//!
//! This module provides access to `LocalScope` table data, which defines the scope ranges
//! where local variables and constants are active within methods. Used by debuggers to
//! determine variable and constant visibility at different execution points.
//!
//! The `LocalScope` table follows the dual-representation pattern used throughout
//! the dotscope library:
//! - [`LocalScopeRaw`] for raw binary data with unresolved indices
//! - [`LocalScope`] for processed data with resolved scope information
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! This table is part of the Portable PDB format and provides essential information
//! for debuggers to determine variable and constant visibility at different execution points.
//! Each scope defines a range of IL instructions where specific variables and constants
//! are accessible, enabling proper debugging support for block-scoped variables.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`LocalScopeRaw`] - Raw table structure with unresolved indices
//! - [`LocalScope`] - Owned variant with resolved references and scope information
//! - [`LocalScopeLoader`] - Internal loader for processing `LocalScope` table data
//! - [`LocalScopeMap`] - Thread-safe concurrent map for caching scope entries
//! - [`LocalScopeList`] - Thread-safe append-only vector for scope collections
//! - [`LocalScopeRc`] - Reference-counted pointer for shared ownership
//!
//! # `LocalScope` Table Structure
//!
//! Each `LocalScope` table row contains these fields:
//! - **Method**: Simple index into `MethodDef` table (method containing scope)
//! - **`ImportScope`**: Simple index into `ImportScope` table (import context)
//! - **`VariableList`**: Simple index into `LocalVariable` table (first variable)
//! - **`ConstantList`**: Simple index into `LocalConstant` table (first constant)
//! - **`StartOffset`**: IL instruction offset where scope begins
//! - **Length**: Length of scope in IL instruction bytes
//!
//! # Usage Examples
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use dotscope::{
//!     metadata::tables::{LocalScopeBuilder, LocalScopeRaw},
//!     CilAssembly, CilAssemblyView,
//! };
//!
//! // A scope covering IL offsets 0x10..0x30 of the first method
//! let mut assembly = CilAssembly::from_path("app.dll")?;
//! LocalScopeBuilder::new()
//!     .method(1)
//!     .import_scope(0)
//!     .variable_list(1)
//!     .constant_list(1)
//!     .start_offset(0x10)
//!     .length(0x20)
//!     .build(&mut assembly)?;
//!
//! let view = CilAssemblyView::from_mem(assembly.to_memory()?)?;
//! if let Some(scopes) = view.tables().and_then(|t| t.table::<LocalScopeRaw>()) {
//!     for scope in scopes.iter().filter_map(Result::ok) {
//!         println!(
//!             "method {}: IL {:#x}..{:#x}",
//!             scope.method,
//!             scope.start_offset,
//!             scope.start_offset + scope.length
//!         );
//!     }
//! }
//! # Ok::<(), dotscope::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! All types in this module are [`Send`] and [`Sync`]. The [`LocalScopeMap`] and
//! [`LocalScopeList`] use lock-free concurrent data structures for efficient
//! multi-threaded access.
