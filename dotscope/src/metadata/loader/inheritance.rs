//! Inheritance chain resolution for .NET metadata.
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive inheritance resolution that runs after TypeDef,
//! TypeRef and TypeSpec have been loaded, ensuring that complex inheritance
//! relationships involving generic type instantiations can be properly resolved.
//!
//! This resolver consolidates all inheritance resolution logic that was previously
//! scattered across individual table loaders, providing a unified and more robust
//! approach to handling circular dependencies.
