//! Raw data loader for emulation.
//!
//! This module provides [`DataLoader`] for mapping raw data regions
//! into the emulation address space. Unlike [`super::PeLoader`] which handles
//! structured PE images, `DataLoader` works with arbitrary byte sequences.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The [`DataLoader`] is a utility for mapping raw data into the emulation
//! memory address space. It supports various mapping scenarios:
//!
//! - Mapping data at specific addresses with custom protection flags
//! - Mapping data at automatically allocated addresses
//! - Loading file contents into memory
//! - Creating zero-initialized memory regions
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use dotscope::emulation::memory::{AddressSpace, MemoryProtection};
//! use dotscope::emulation::loader::DataLoader;
//!
//! let address_space = AddressSpace::new();
//!
//! // Map read-only data at a specific address
//! let info = DataLoader::map_readonly(
//!     &address_space,
//!     0x10000,
//!     vec![0x01, 0x02, 0x03],
//!     "constants",
//! )?;
//!
//! // Map read-write data
//! let info = DataLoader::map_readwrite(
//!     &address_space,
//!     0x20000,
//!     vec![0u8; 0x1000],
//!     "buffer",
//! )?;
//! ```
//!
//! # Memory Protection
//!
//! The loader supports all standard memory protection combinations through
//! [`MemoryProtection`](crate::emulation::memory::MemoryProtection) flags:
//!
//! - `READ` - Memory can be read
//! - `WRITE` - Memory can be written
//! - `EXECUTE` - Memory can be executed as code

/// Raw data loader for mapping arbitrary data into the address space.
///
/// `DataLoader` provides static methods to map raw byte data into the emulation
/// address space. It is a stateless utility struct - all methods are associated
/// functions that operate directly on an [`AddressSpace`](crate::emulation::memory::AddressSpace).
///
/// # Design
///
/// Unlike [`PeLoader`](super::PeLoader) which parses and maps PE structures,
/// `DataLoader` treats data as opaque byte sequences. This makes it suitable for:
///
/// - Loading raw binary blobs
/// - Creating memory buffers for emulation
/// - Mapping configuration data or constants
/// - Setting up stack and heap regions
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// All methods are thread-safe as they only require shared references to the
/// address space. The underlying memory regions use internal synchronization.
