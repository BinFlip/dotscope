//! Data types for captured emulation results.
//!
//! This module defines all data structures used to represent captured data
//! during .NET emulation. Each captured item includes metadata about where
//! and when it was captured, enabling correlation with the execution flow.
//!
//! # Structure
//!
//! Captured items are organized by type:
//!
//! - [`CapturedAssembly`]: Dynamically loaded assemblies
//! - [`CapturedString`]: Decrypted or generated strings
//! - [`CapturedBuffer`]: Raw byte buffers from memory operations
//! - [`CapturedMethodReturn`]: Return values from monitored methods
//! - [`FileOperation`]: File system operations
//! - [`NetworkOperation`]: Network operations
//! - [`MemorySnapshot`]: Point-in-time memory captures
//!
//! All captured items include a [`CaptureSource`] that identifies exactly
//! where in the emulation the capture occurred.

/// Source location identifying where a capture occurred during emulation.
///
/// Every captured item includes a `CaptureSource` that records the exact location
/// in the emulation where the capture occurred. This enables correlation between
/// captured data and the execution flow, helping to understand which code path
/// produced each captured item.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// The source location is identified by four components:
/// - The method token (which method was executing)
/// - The thread ID (which emulation thread)
/// - The IL offset within the method
/// - The global instruction count (for ordering captures chronologically)
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// use dotscope::emulation::capture::CaptureSource;
/// use dotscope::emulation::ThreadId;
/// use dotscope::metadata::token::Token;
