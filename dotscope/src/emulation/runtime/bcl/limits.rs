//! Argument validation and allocation ceilings shared by BCL method hooks.
//!
//! # Why hooks need their own ceilings
//!
//! The emulator's instruction budget is evaluated between CIL instructions, in the dispatch
//! loop. A BCL hook runs entirely *inside* one such instruction: once dispatch enters
//! `String.PadLeft` or `Rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes`, no budget is consulted again until the
//! hook returns. A hook that loops or allocates in proportion to an argument it took from the
//! emulated evaluation stack is therefore unbounded by construction, no matter how small the
//! configured instruction limit is.
//!
//! Every hook that sizes work from an emulated value must bound that value itself, before
//! doing the work. The helpers here provide the two checks that need to happen together:
//!
//! 1. **Sign.** Emulated counts arrive as `int32`/`int64`. A bare `as usize` turns `-1` into
//!    `usize::MAX`, which downstream code then tries to honour. Use [`checked_len`], which
//!    converts with `TryFrom` and reports a negative argument as the managed exception .NET
//!    itself raises.
//! 2. **Magnitude.** A positive but absurd count is just as effective — `int.MaxValue` is a
//!    perfectly valid `usize`. [`checked_len`] also enforces a ceiling.
//!
//! Failures are returned as [`PreHookResult::Throw`] rather than
//! [`PreHookResult::Error`](crate::emulation::runtime::hook::PreHookResult::Error), so they
//! flow through CIL exception handling. Emulated code that guards a large allocation with
//! `try`/`catch` — which obfuscator runtimes and packers routinely do — then behaves as it
//! would on a real runtime, instead of the whole emulation being abandoned.
