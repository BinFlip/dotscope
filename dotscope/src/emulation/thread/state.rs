//! Emulation thread implementation.
//!
//! This module provides the per-thread execution state for .NET emulation,
//! including the call stack, evaluation stack, instruction pointer, and
//! exception handling state.
//!
//! # Thread Structure
//!
//! Each emulation thread maintains:
//!
//! - **Call Stack**: Stack of [`ThreadCallFrame`]s representing method calls
//! - **Evaluation Stack**: The CIL evaluation stack for intermediate values
//! - **Exception State**: Current exception handling context
//! - **Thread-Local Storage**: Per-thread data storage
//!
//! # Call Frame Layout
//!
//! Each call frame ([`ThreadCallFrame`]) contains:
//!
//! - Method token identifying the executing method
//! - Local variables storage
//! - Argument storage
//! - Instruction pointer (current offset in method body)
//! - Saved caller stack for method returns
//!
//! # Thread States
//!
//! Threads transition through [`ThreadState`]:
//!
//! 1. `Ready` - Created but not yet running
//! 2. `Running` - Actively executing instructions
//! 3. `Waiting` - Blocked on synchronization ([`WaitReason`] specifies why)
//! 4. Terminal: `Completed`, `Faulted`, or `Aborted`
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use dotscope::emulation::thread::{EmulationThread, ThreadCallFrame};
//!
//! // Create a thread
//! let mut thread = EmulationThread::new(thread_id, address_space, capture, assembly);
//!
//! // Start executing a method
//! thread.start_method(method_token, locals, args, expects_return);
//!
//! // Push/pop values on evaluation stack
//! thread.push(EmValue::I32(42))?;
//! let value = thread.pop()?;
//! ```
