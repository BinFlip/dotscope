//! Generic cleanup utilities for deobfuscation.
//!
//! This module provides deobfuscation-specific cleanup operations that build on
//! the generic [`cilassembly::cleanup`](crate::cilassembly::cleanup) infrastructure.
//!
//! The deobfuscation cleanup adds:
//! - Dead method collection from analysis
//! - Entry point protection (preserves public methods, constructors, etc.)
//! - Obfuscated name renaming
//! - Event logging for statistics
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Obfuscator-specific modules should:
//! 1. Detect what tokens need to be removed (types, methods, fields)
//! 2. Create a [`CleanupRequest`](crate::cilassembly::CleanupRequest) with those tokens
//! 3. Call [`execute_cleanup`] to perform the cleanup
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! The `examples::module_example` test in this module runs this example.
