//! On-demand emulation process with double-checked locking.
//!
//! [`ProcessCell`] encapsulates the `AtomicBool` + `RwLock<Option<EmulationProcess>>`
//! double-checked locking pattern shared by multiple deobfuscation passes
//! ([`OpaqueFieldPredicatePass`], [`DelegateProxyResolutionPass`], [`StaticFieldResolutionPass`]).
//!
//! Each pass needs an emulation process that is lazily forked from the shared
//! [`EmulationTemplatePool`] on first use, with optional targeted `.cctor` warmup.
//! This helper eliminates the duplicated initialization logic while allowing
//! callers to customize what happens after the process is created (via a callback
//! passed to [`ensure_initialized`](ProcessCell::ensure_initialized)).
