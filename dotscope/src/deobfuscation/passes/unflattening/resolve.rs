//! Direct resolution of dispatcher edges.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Control flow flattening replaces every original edge `A -> B` with a pair of
//! edges through a dispatcher: `A` assigns the state value that encodes `B` and
//! jumps to the dispatcher, which switches on that value and lands on `B`.
//! Undoing it means recovering, for each edge that feeds the dispatcher, the
//! state value travelling along it — and then rewiring that edge straight to the
//! block the dispatcher would have chosen.
//!
//! That is a *per-edge* question, and SSA already answers it: the state reaching
//! the dispatcher is a phi whose operands are indexed by predecessor, so the
//! value arriving from `A` is exactly the operand `A` contributes. No execution
//! path has to be explored to read it.
//!
//! The alternative — walking the method from entry and forking at every
//! conditional to see which states show up where — answers the same question by
//! enumerating paths, and there are exponentially many of those. On a flattened
//! NetReactor method that costs millions of trace nodes per dispatcher to
//! recover a few hundred edges, and it re-explores the whole method once per
//! dispatcher because the walk always restarts at entry. Reading phi operands is
//! linear in the number of edges, and each dispatcher only reads its own.
//!
//! # Merge points
//!
//! The state does not always merge at the dispatcher itself. Obfuscators route
//! it through a chain of copies, and several original edges may meet at a phi
//! one or more blocks above the switch. An operand that is not constant is
//! therefore followed to the phi that defines it, and that phi's operands are
//! resolved in turn. Rewiring then targets the edges into *that* block, which is
//! only sound when everything between it and the dispatcher is state plumbing —
//! copies and unconditional jumps — so the blocks skipped carry no program
//! behaviour. [`pure_chain_between`] enforces exactly that.
//!
//! # Partial results are safe
//!
//! An edge whose state cannot be determined is simply left alone: it keeps
//! routing through the dispatcher, which stays correct but flattened. Coverage
//! degrades, never correctness.
//!
//! Resolution itself is a pure read of the function; [`apply_rewires`] performs
//! the mutation.
