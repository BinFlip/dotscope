//! The validator test harness.
//!
//! A validator's test hands [`validator_test`] or [`owned_validator_test`] a factory of
//! [`TestAssembly`]s: a clean assembly the validator accepts, and crafted ones that each break
//! one rule. Every crafted case states the [`ExpectedError`] the validator must reject it with,
//! so a case never passes on an unrelated failure. The harness first sets each case up (load
//! the bytes, scan references, load the project for an owned validator); a case it cannot set
//! up fails the test whichever way it was expected to go, because the validator never ran.
//! Every case runs, and every mismatch is reported together.
