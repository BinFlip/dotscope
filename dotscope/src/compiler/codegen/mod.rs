//! SSA to CIL code generation.
//!
//! Converts SSA back to CIL bytecode, completing the roundtrip
//! CIL -> SSA -> (transformations) -> CIL.
//!
//! # How a body is generated
//!
//! 1. **Storage** ([`storage`]): which values are emitted at their use rather
//!    than given a row ([`FoldForest`](analyssa::analysis::folding::FoldForest)),
//!    which share a slot ([`Gathering`](analyssa::analysis::webs::Gathering)),
//!    and which argument or local slot each web is, with its type. Decided once,
//!    from one model of the order the body is emitted in.
//! 2. **Layout**: blocks ordered so fall-through paths need no jump, exception
//!    regions contiguous, and every phi-carrying edge out of a multi-way branch
//!    given a block of its own.
//! 3. **Emission**: each block's operations in SSA order. An operation's
//!    operands are loaded from their slots or produced in place as expression
//!    trees; its result is stored to its slot, or left for the consumer it was
//!    folded into. Phi copies are one parallel copy per predecessor.
//! 4. **Validation** ([`validate`]): the finished body is checked against the
//!    SSA by an independent abstract interpretation. A body that reads a value
//!    other than the one the SSA names, reorders an effect or truncates a value
//!    in a narrow slot is refused, and the method keeps its original IL.
//!
//! # Module Organization
//!
//! - [`emitter`]: Low-level CIL instruction emission helpers
//! - [`storage`]: Folding, slot sharing and slot typing
//! - [`validate`]: Translation validation of generated bodies
