//! Write context for streaming PE file generation.
//!
//! This module provides [`WriteContext`], a unified context that carries all state
//! needed during PE file generation. It replaces the previous `Layout` struct with
//! a streaming approach where values are collected during writing and fixups are
//! applied at the end.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The generation process has three phases:
//!
//! 1. **Initialize**: Create context with assembly reference and output
//! 2. **Write**: Stream all content sequentially, tracking positions
//! 3. **Fixup**: Patch headers with final values (sizes, RVAs, checksum)
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let mut ctx = WriteContext::new(assembly, output)?;
//!
//! // Write all content - ctx tracks positions
//! ctx.write_dos_header()?;
//! ctx.write_pe_headers()?;
//! ctx.write_sections()?;
//!
//! // Apply fixups and finalize
//! ctx.apply_fixups()?;
//! ctx.finalize()?;
//! ```

///
/// # Overview
///
/// The context tracks:
/// - **Source references**: Assembly and changes being written
/// - **Output state**: Memory-mapped file and current write position
/// - **PE format info**: Alignment values, image base, PE32/PE32+ format
/// - **Header positions**: File offsets for fixup patching after write
/// - **Section tracking**: Dynamic section info collected during write
/// - **Metadata positions**: Heap and stream offsets for CLR metadata
/// - **Native import/export**: Optional P/Invoke and native export data
/// - **Remapping tables**: Method RVA and heap offset translations
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// 1. **Construction**: [`WriteContext::new`] initializes from source assembly
/// 2. **Write phase**: Generator writes content, context tracks positions
/// 3. **Fixup phase**: Headers patched with collected values
/// 4. **Finalization**: Output truncated to actual size, checksum written
///
/// # Section Tracking
///

/// as each section's data is written. This allows proper handling of:
/// - Variable section ordering (not all PEs have sections in the same order)
/// - Section removal (e.g., filtered .reloc sections)
